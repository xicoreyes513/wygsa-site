            There was never one specific moment where I knew I was gay. 
            Rather, it was a string of instances weaving together and 
            forming the realization. I would only be friends with girls. 
            I never showed an interest in stereotypically straight things. 
            I was always questioning whether or not I was actually 
            attracted to a girl or if I was just told that I should be. 
            This went on throughout my life until about 5th grade. 
            It was as if one final piece clicked into place and I realized 
            how inauthentically I had been living my life. This realization 
            was terrifying to me. While my parents had always told me they 
            would love me unconditionally, I couldn't help but fear what 
            they would do if I told them. I can distinctly remember the 
            day I came out. It was 2018 and the Pulse nightclub shooting 
            had occurred only months prior. Thinking about all those 
            people's lives being ended short because of their sexuality 
            was extremely poignant to me. If I don't come out, I could 
            end up dying without ever being to tell anyone. Very 
            melodramatic in retrospect, but the point still stands. 
            On a trip to Target, of all places, I told my mom that I was 
            bisexual. This was not true. I believe subconsciously I 
            wanted to “soften the blow,” so to speak. If they weren't 
            accepting of me dating a guy, they would still have the 
            possibility of dating a girl. My mom's reaction surprised me, 
            she was extremely accepting and comforted me, as I was 
            bawling uncontrollably.

        <ul>
          <li>
            For the past years I've always questioned myself whether I'm 
            attracted to boys or girls because I've always found myself 
            having crushes and attraction to the same and opposite gender. 
            So I did some research and a lot of questioning and it came 
            down to Bisexual. But I also questioned my gender. At first I 
            thought I identified as a girl/female but there would be a lot 
            of times where I find myself not identifying as any gender and 
            that's when I discovered Non-Binary. The same thing I did for 
            Bisexual I did the same for Non-Binary which was do a lot of 
            research and a lot of questioning. But at one point in life 
            I actually found myself feeling and identifying as a boy, girl.  
            (comfortably) Sometimes I would even fall into the Non-Bianry 
            umbrella and that's when I officially found out I was  gender 
            fluid. It felt good to finally find myself and be who I am. If 
            you're wondering, my pronouns are he/him and they/him. There would 
            be a lot of ups and downs questioning whether I'm straight or 
            if I'm really bisexual. But ever since I met this one girl I've 
            had feelings for her for about a while  now and I finally had the 
            guts and courage to tell her how I feel. When I noticed that I knew I
             was bisexual because like I said I've had attractions and crushes 
             for both genders. I came out to my sister, cousin and a couple of 
             friends. I was crying because I was so happy to see the amount of 
             love and support from my friends and family.
