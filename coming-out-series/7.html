        <h3>Demi Lovato</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demi Lovato discovered their sexuality when they were 
            young as they watched Cruel Intentions, a classic 90's film. 
            Though they knew they were pansexual at a young age, they
            did not come out till they were 17. Demi first came out as 
            pansexual to their sister and friends when they were 17. Then 
            they came out to the public. “So, there's been moments in my 
            life that have been very confusing to me, you know being 10 
            years old, attracted to women and not knowing what that meant 
            as a Christian and being raised in the South where that's not 
            very open. You know, it's harder there”. Demi reflected on the 
            experience of coming out to her parents, recalling: “It was 
            actually…emotional but really beautiful”.  Then, in the first 
            episode of their new podcast 4D, Lovato says, "Over the past 
            year and a half, I've been doing some healing and self-reflective 
            work. And through this work, I've had the revelation that I identify 
            as nonbinary. With that said, I'll be officially changing my 
            pronouns to they/them” Demi's continues to support and uplift the 
            LGBTQ+ community through music, fundraisers, and awareness. Demi's 
            openness about her coming out process allows others to understand 
            that it is a challenging thing to do, even for a world renowned 
            celebrity.

        <h3>Ellen Degeneres</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ellen DeGeneres officially announced her sexuality to the 
            public on April 14th, 1997 on TV. She appeared on the Oprah 
            Winfrey Show, specifically "The Puppet Episode". During the 
            episode, Ellen is at the airport looking for a woman named 
            Susan, assuming Susan was going to depart someplace else. In 
            the show, the two women had been flirting the day before, and 
            Ellen wanted to tell Susan one last thing before she left. 
            Before telling Susan who she truly is and how she truly feels,
             Ellen contemplated her decision. Then all of a sudden, 
             she blurts "I'm gay." to Susan, but little did she know the 
             intercom was on, therefore revealing herself to everyone in 
             the airport. This episode then became viral where Ellen was 
             known as the woman who revealed her sexuality  on TV. What a 
             clever way to come out! To this day everyone still make references 
             or remembers the way Ellen revealed her true identity .

        <h3>Halsey</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Although Halsey never really came out, she has spoke 
            openly about her bisexuality in her video for the 2018 
            GLAAD awards. In the video she gives her speech for winning 
            the Outstanding Music Artist award, where she nonchalantly 
            mentions  how she worked hard to be a better representative 
            for the LGBTQ+ community, specifically for the bisexual 
            friends like her. This video then answers all questions about
             Halsey sexuality.

        <h3>Amandla Stenberg</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Amandla Stenberg is an American actress who is known for 
            her roles in movies such as  “The Hate You Give” and 
            “Everything, Everything”. In 2018, Amandla came out as gay. 
            “Gender and sexuality are so fluid—it's okay to change your 
            mind a million times and figure out what works for you. It's 
            okay to take your time… I'd been out as bisexual, and people 
            have known I'm queer for a long time.” Amandla continues to 
            support the LGBTQ+ community with using their platform to talk 
            about being comfortable with your sexuality, and their journey
             as a gay person.

        <h3>Elliot Page</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When Elliot Paige was nine years old, he cut his hair 
            short for the first time. It was exhilarating for him 
            and was one of the first moments of gender euphoria. This 
            was short lived though, as he was required to grow out his 
            hair for an acting job a year later. Now, at 34 years of age, 
            Elliot has come out as trans. He is possibly one of the most 
            famous trans people on the world. He describes the feeling as 
            “true excitement and deep gratitude mixed with a lot of fear 
            and anxiety”
