        <h3>5 Things to Know about Pansexuality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The word pansexuality originally comes from Greek. Pan means 'all',
             and is related to words like panorama. Pansexual people aren't 
             attracted to all other people, but they are attracted to people of all
             genders. This is different from being attracted to everyone; in the same 
             way that a heterosexual woman will not be attracted to all men and a 
             lesbian woman will not be attracted to all women, pansexual people 
             will experience attraction to specific people and not others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pansexuality is different from bisexuality but the two aren't 
            mutually exclusive. Being bisexual means being attracted to more 
            than one gender, while being pansexual means being attracted to 
            people regardless of gender. Pansexuality and bisexuality are not in 
            conflict. In fact, some bisexual people also identify as pansexual, 
            and vice versa. Pansexuality is included under the bisexual umbrella, 
            which covers anyone who experiences romantic attraction to more than one gender.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pansexuality is not rare. Being pansexual is not the same as being polyamorous.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though many pansexual people also identify as polyamorous, pansexuality 
            is about the gender of the people one is attracted to, while the polyamory 
            is about the ability and commitment to form relationships with more than one 
            person. Not all pansexual people are polyamorous and not all polyamorous 
            people are pansexual.Contrary to popular belief, bisexuality is becoming 
            increasingly common in America, both in terms of people who self-identify 
            using the term. As people become more educated on nonbinary identities, 
            it stands to reason that pansexuality will become an increasingly common 
            orientation as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being pansexual is just one part of who someone is. A pansexual person 
            may also be trans, or disabled, or a person of color, or all three. 
            Pansexual people come in all ages and sizes and enjoy a range of activities 
            and hobbies. On pansexual visibility day it's important to remember that we're 
            celebrating pansexual people from all backgrounds and all walks of life

        <h3>Message from Whittier Youth GSA Mentor, Scarlett</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Happy Pansexual Pride Day! I have been an out and proud pansexual since the 7th grade. 
            Most of what I have heard since coming out as pansexual is stuff like: “You're 
            too young to know what you are” and  “That's not a real thing”. Well, 
            pansexuality is a real, and very valid sexuality. I identify as pansexual 
            \because I like people based on personality rather than sexuality or identity. Some things 
            I've faced in the LGBTQ+ community is the stigma of bisexual erasure. While being bisexual 
            and pansexual have it's similarities, pansexual is a label I feel the most 
            comfortable identifying with. I also feel that as members or allys in the LGBTQ+ 
            community, we should all celebrate each other for being ourselves, rather than 
            tearing each other down. No matter what you identify as, you are completely valid. 
            I am so thankful to have an awesome community that allows me to be myself, and 
            I hope that by reading this, you also feel that you have a community to support 
            you here at Whittier Youth GSA!
