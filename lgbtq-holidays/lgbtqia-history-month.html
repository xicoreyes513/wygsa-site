        <h3>Stonewall Riots</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Stonewall riots is a series of violent confrontations that began in the early 
            hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists outside the Stonewall Inn, 
            a gay bar in the Greenwich Village section of New York City.
          </li>
          <li>In the 1960s solicitation of same-sex relations was illegal in New York City. 
            So, LGBTQIA+ individuals flocked to gay bars and clubs, where they could express 
            themselves openly and socialize without worry.</li>
          <li>However, the New York State Liquor Authority penalized and 
            shut down establishments that served alcohol to known or suspected 
            LGBT individuals, arguing that the mere gathering of homosexuals was 
            “disorderly.”</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="lgbtq-holidays-row">
        <h3>Harvey Milk</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Harvey Bernard Milk was an American politician who became the first
            openly gay person to be elected to public office in California when 
            he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1973, Harvey ran for supervisor, for the first time, with not 
            much support from gay political clubs. In 1975, Harvey ran for the 
            second time, losing only by a small amount of votes. In 1977, for 
            his third running, Harvey Milk successfully won a seat on the San 
            Francisco Board of Supervisors
          </li>
          <li>
            Milk's loud and unapologetic proclamation of his authenticity 
            as an openly gay candidate for public office, and his election 
            gave never before experienced hope to LGBTQIA+ people everywhere 
            at a time when the community was encountering widespread hostility 
            and discrimination
          </li>
          <li>
            During his tenure as supervisor, he helped pass a gay rights 
            ordinance for the city of San Francisco that prohibited 
            anti-gay discrimination in housing and employment
          </li>
          <li>
            Harvey Milk has been honored twice under President Obama's administration. 
            First, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 
            2009. In 2014, he was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 
            Forever Stamp in 2014.

        <h3>Creator of LGBTQIA+ Flag</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gilbert Baker was an openly gay American artist, 
            gay rights activist, drag queen and designer of the rainbow flag, 
            a worldwide symbol of LGBTQIA+ pride. His flag became widely 
            associated with LGBTQIA+ rights causes, a symbol of gay pride 
            that has become ubiquitous in the decades since its debut
          </li>
          <li>
            Baker revealed that he was urged by Harvey Milk to create a 
            symbol of pride for the gay community. Baker decided to make 
            that symbol a flag because he saw flags as the most powerful symbol 
            of pride. As he later said in an interview, “Our job as gay people 
            was to come out, to be visible, to live in the truth, as I say, 
            to get out of the lie. A flag really fit that mission, because 
            that's a way of proclaiming your visibility or saying, 'This is who I am!'"
            Baker saw the rainbow as a natural flag from the sky, so he adopted 
            eight colors for the stripes, each color with its own meaning.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was not until 1994 that the rainbow flag was truly 
            established as the symbol for LGBTQIA+ pride. That year 
            Baker made a mile-long version for the 25th anniversary of the 
            Stonewall riots. Now the rainbow flag is an international symbol for 
            LGBTQIA+ pride and can be seen flying proudly, during both the promising 
            times and the difficult ones, all around the world

        <h3>LGBTQIA+ Activists</h3>
        <h5>Marsha P. Johnson</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            She was black, queer, and trans — and fearlessly advocated for 
            her rights and the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community at a time 
            when doing so put her safety in jeopardy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Sylvia Rivera</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rivera was a Latina trans activist, who, together with Marsha P. Johnson, 
            co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), 
            an organization that provided housing and other services to 
            homeless LGBTQIA+ youth in New York City.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Edith Windsor</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Windsor got married in Canada. Her wife passed away two years later. 
            Because the US did not recognize their same-sex marriage, Windsor was 
            asked to pay taxes on Spyer's estate far beyond what a heterosexual 
            spouse would be required to pay on the estate of their deceased spouse. 
            Windsor took her case to court and in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in her 
            favor. Two years later, the court expanded on that ruling in another case that 
            led to federal recognition of same-sex marriages.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Alice Nkom</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Nkom is a human rights lawyer and LGBTQIA+ activist from Cameroon, 
            where homosexuality is still criminalized. In a country where police 
            officer entrap members of the LGBTQIA+ community through text messages 
            and beat those they perceive to be gay, Nkom bravely fights for rights 
            on behalf of the LGBTQIA+ community
