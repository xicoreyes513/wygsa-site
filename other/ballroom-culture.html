        <h3>What is Ballroom?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ball culture, drag ball culture, the house-ballroom community, the ballroom scene or ballroom 
            culture and similar terms describe a young African-American and Latin American underground 
            LGBTQ+ subculture that originated in New York City, in which people "walk" for trophies, 
            prizes, and glory at events known as balls.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="other-row">
        <h3>Who started it? Where?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the early 1970s, Harlem drag queen Lottie LaBeija convinced Crystal LaBeija 
            to promote her own ball. Crystal agreed, and the House of LaBeija—the first 
            ever ballroom “house”—was born, with Crystal at the helm as the “mother.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Crystal and Lottie went on to host the first house ball in Harlem in the 
            early 1970s, entitling it “Crystal & Lottie LaBeija presents the first 
            annual House of LaBeija Ball.” The ball, designed exclusively for Black 
            and Latinx trans, gay and queer people, was a success.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>How were Houses created?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kids who were left homeless after being kicked out by homophobic or 
            transphobic relatives, formed their own families, known as houses. 
            These houses were named after the head, or “mother” of the house — 
            an elder queer person who was often not much older than their 
            “children.” They all lived and competed as a family to bring glory, 
            in the form of trophies, to their houses, earning the title of “legendary”.

        <h3>Competition
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To compete against each other, Houses "walk" in the balls judged on 
            vogue skills, costumes, appearance, and attitude. Participants 
            dress according to the category in which they are competing, and 
            are expected to display appropriate "realness".The largest balls 
            last as long as ten hours, with dozens of categories in a single evening
          </li>

          <li>
            With fewer spectators, nearly everyone comes to compete; some trophies are 
            12 feet tall, and a grand-prize winner can earn $1,000 or more.

            New York City
            <ul>
              <li>
                New York City is the epicenter of the world's drag ball culture. 
                Crystal LaBeija and Lottie began their own drag ball titled 'House of LaBeija,' 
                kickstarting the current ballroom scene in New York

          <li>Washington, DC
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Washington ballroom scene was created in the mid to late 1980s by 
                Icon Lowell Adonis Khanh, Icon Eric Christian-Bazaar, and Icon Mother 
                Juan Aviance. During the 1990s, more houses appeared in the area due 
                to the efforts of Twain Miyake-Mugler, Icon Harold Balenciaga, Icons 
                Shannon Garcon and Whitney Garcon. The city hosts a series of annual

                In 1931, the newspaper Baltimore Afro-American covered a local 
                drag ball. By the 1930s, the drag ball culture was starting to 
                merge in the Black communities in major cities such as Baltimore, 
                Chicago, and New York.
