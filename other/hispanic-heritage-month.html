        <h3>Gender Pronouns In Spanish
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most gendered words in Spanish end with an “o” or “a” to show if 
            it is feminine or masculine. But, more recently, "x" has been used 
            at the end of words to show inclusivity to those who may not 
            identify with male or female pronouns. Some have trouble pronouncing 
            the "x" so instead of having the “x” at the end, you can also use "e". 
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: Latino / Latina / Latinx / Latine
          </li>
          <li>
            They / Them = Elle / Elles 
          </li>
          <li>
            Amigo/Amiga =  Amige, Amix, Ami, Amigis 
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-binary = “Género no binaria” “No binarie”
